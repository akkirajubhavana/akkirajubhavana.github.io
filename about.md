Hi! I'm **Bhavana Akkiraju**, a Ph.D. scholar in the **Speech Processing Laboratory** at the [Language Technologies Research Center (LTRC)](https://www.iiit.ac.in/research/labs/speech/), **IIIT-Hyderabad**, under the supervision of [Dr. Anil Kumar Vuppala](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~anil/).  

### 👩‍🔬 Research Focus

My research lies at the intersection of:

- 🧠 **Speech Foundation Models** for Indian languages
- 🌐 **Multilingual & Low-Resource Speech Recognition (ASR)**
- ✨ **Prompt-based and Few-shot ASR**
- 🎙️ **Generative AI for Speech** (e.g., SeamlessM4T, Whisper)
- 🧬 **Domain Adaptation for  Speech Recognition**

### 💼 Professional Journey

Before joining academia, I worked for over 3 years as a **Senior Software Engineer** at **Capgemini** and **Brillio**, where I built scalable AI/ML systems for enterprise environments.

I hold an **M.Tech in Embedded Systems** (ECE), which shaped my grounding in systems engineering, real-time processing, and AI at the edge.

### 🎯 Vision

My core research vision is to **build Speech Foundation Models** that are tailored for **Indian languages**, especially in the domains of:

- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**
- **Speech-to-Text Translation (SLT)**
- **Cross-lingual generalization for low-resource scenarios**

I aim to create inclusive and robust speech technologies that enable real-world deployment in **healthcare**, **education**, and **public services**, with a focus on **linguistic diversity, code-switching, and domain adaptation**.
