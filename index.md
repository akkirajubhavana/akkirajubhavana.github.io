## 🎯 Mission

> _To build **multimodal speech foundation models** tailored for **Indian languages**, tackling data scarcity and reducing reliance on task-specific systems._

> _To advance research in **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** and **Spoken Language Translation (SLT)** across diverse, low-resource languages._

> _To explore the integration of **Generative AI (GenAI)** with speech technologies for more adaptive and generalizable systems._

## 🔬 Current Research Directions

- 🧠 Speech Foundation Models: Designing large-scale models for Indian languages across ASR, SLT, and downstream tasks.
- 🗣️ Few-shot & Prompt-based Speech Recognition: Leveraging models like SeamlessM4T and Whisper for low-resource and adaptive ASR.
- 🌍 Spoken Language Translation (SLT): Enabling end-to-end translation from speech in one language to text in another.
- 🔤 Multilingual & Low-Resource ASR: Developing robust models for underrepresented Indian languages using cross-lingual transfer.   
- 🧬 Speech Disorder Analysis via IMF & HHT: Applying signal decomposition methods to analyze and differentiate disordered speech.
